<h1 align="center">Description</h1>

<p align="center">
  This is a simple Java project for a calculator. The calculator provides basic arithmetic operations, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It also supports decimal points, clear display, backspace, and changing the sign. I built this with a tutorial but I added other features, the user can now type with the computer keyboard and delete using the backspace.
